Instead of rolling dice, you can also try Rock – Paper – Scissors.
## Project Title
<h4> Rock – Paper – Scissors (without Lizard - Spock) </h4>

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to implement the classic game of Rock – Paper – Scissors using Python. The game allows two players to make their moves and determines the winner based on the predefined rules of the game. The rules are as follows:

</figure><br>
The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g., "rock"), the game outcome is "draw".

## Solution
The game is implemented using Python programming language. The solution involves capturing user inputs, generating a random move for the computer player, and comparing the moves to determine the winner. The project utilizes basic programming concepts and conditional statements to implement the game logic.

## Technologies Used
