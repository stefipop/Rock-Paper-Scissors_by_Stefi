Instead of rolling dice, you can also try Rock – Paper – Scissors.
## Project Title
<h4> Rock – Paper – Scissors (without Lizard - Spock) </h4>

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to implement the classic game of Rock – Paper – Scissors using Python. The game allows two players to make their moves and determines the winner based on the predefined rules of the game. The rules are as follows:

The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g., "rock"), the game outcome is "draw". Well, I tried to make a slightly more fun version, on the topic of Oracle. Follow the directions!<br> <strong>You must choose 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, and 's' for scissors, regardless of whether the letter is uppercase.</strong>


## Solution
- The 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game is a fun and interactive decision-making tool implemented using a combination of fundamental algorithms, Python programming language, and the Colorama library for colored output in the console.<br>
- To start, the program captures the player's move choice by accepting input in the form of 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors. The input is processed and mapped to the corresponding move (rock, paper, or scissors) using conditional statements.<br>
- Similarly, the computer's move is randomly generated using the random module to determine the winner based on the game rules, and the move is announced with a randomly chosen phrase. A commented line in the source code (line 28) can manipulate the computer's random selection. You can remove the hashtag (set new on line 29!) and change the outcome of the randomness in your favor. Change the weight [0.4, 0.3, 0.3] depending on which of the three options you want to drop more often!<br>
The outcome of the game is determined by comparing the player's move to the computer's move. This comparison is performed using conditional statements that follow the standard rules of 'Rock-Paper-Scissors': rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The result is displayed with appropriate colored text using the Colorama library, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.<br>
- To enhance the user experience, the program incorporates personalized and humorous messages for different outcomes, including winning, drawing, and losing. These messages are randomly selected from predefined lists of phrases, adding an element of fun and surprise to the game.
The outcome of each round is displayed, with celebratory messages for winning, humorous remarks for a draw, and encouraging messages for losing. Players have the option to play again by pressing 'y' or exit the game by pressing 'n'.<br>
- Experience the thrill of 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' and let fate decide your destiny!"
